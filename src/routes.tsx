  // Each component takes a different set of OwnProps, which leads
  // to two problems with just calling the component with the props
  // here.
  //
  // - OwnProps is an exact object, so we can't call a component
  //   with "extra" props. We get all of the ContextRouter props and
  //   there's no way to distinguish which of those is needed for
  //   the component, so we have to pass all of them. It's true that
  //   every OwnProps is essentially derived from the ContextRouter
  //   type, so we *could* conceptually always use that, but that
  //   means we don't get a clear understanding of which Route prop
  //   each component uses. Besides, even if we do that...
  //
  // - We also customize the `match` type to better reflect the
  //   params we expect to get from react-router based on the path.
  //   react-router just gives us a string map, which isn't super
  //   helpful. Collection components replace that with
  //   CollectionRouteMatch etc. to assert that there should always
  //   be e.g. a bid and a cid. Fixing the types here would require
  //   adding some extra logic to ensure that the match we get is
  //   what we expect (and if not.. throw?).
  //
  // But if we didn't wrap react-router, everything would be
  // fine. Why is that? Of course, it's because react-router is
  // written in JS and the typings in flow-typed aren't
  // exact. `Route` is specified to take a component of any type,
  // which gets unified with the OwnProps we actually take, even
  // though `Route` always passes the complete set of router
  // props. We can't reproduce this behavior in correctly-typed
  // code, so let's not even try.

  // $FlowFixMe: maybe wait until we get better types for react-router

  // @ts-ignore
